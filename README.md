### Custom WordPress Theme Development

The Flyrbord theme is designed to support small businesses by offering a flexible, easy to use interface to manage their site. This theme does not include a database component (ACF), relying on Elementor and Kirki for content management and theme options.

### Build Commands
`npm install`
`bower install`
`gulp` <- builds project and exits process (ideal for CI / release)
`gulp watch` <- ideal for dev
